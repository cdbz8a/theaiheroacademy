## PROBLEM SECTION

### Why most AI learning stalls
You’ve tried tools. You’ve watched tutorials. But output quality is inconsistent, prompts feel hit-or-miss, and high-stakes work still feels risky.

AI Hero Academy closes the gap between "knowing AI exists" and "using AI effectively every week."

---

## OUTCOMES SECTION

## What you’ll leave with
By the end of the workshop, you will be able to:
- Choose the right AI tool for each task
- Use a 5-part prompt framework for better outputs
- Draft and refine work faster without losing your voice
- Verify facts and catch hallucinations before they create risk
- Execute a 30-day implementation plan with measurable wins
