## 1. Title Slide
**AI Hero Academy**  
Practical AI for Work & Life  
6–8 Hour Hands-On Workshop

---

## 2. Welcome + What Today Is About
- AI as a partner, not a replacement
- Learn by doing (60% practice)
- Leave with templates + action plan

---

## 3. Outcomes for Today
By the end, you will:
- Choose the right AI tool for each task
- Write effective prompts quickly
- Apply AI to emails, meetings, docs, planning
- Verify outputs and avoid common risks
- Build your 30-day rollout plan

---

## 4. Ground Rules
- Experiment freely
- Ask anything
- Keep private data private
- Verify important outputs
- Human judgment stays in charge

---

## 5. Module 0: Task Harvest
**Prompt:** “What wastes the most time in your week?”
- Write 10–15 recurring tasks
- Circle top 3 highest-value tasks
- These will be used throughout class

---

## 6. AI Then vs Now
- ELIZA (pattern script)
- Modern LLMs (advanced language modeling)
- Why this feels different now

---

## 7. What AI Is (and Isn’t)
AI is:
- Fast pattern generation
- Great for first drafts, summaries, options

AI is not:
- Automatically accurate
- A replacement for accountability
- Safe for confidential data by default

---

## 8. Human + AI Partnership Model
1. Human sets context + goals + constraints
2. AI generates options quickly
3. Human verifies, edits, and decides

---

## 9. Hallucinations: The Big Risk
Red flags:
- Specific claims with no sources
- Fake citations
- Overconfident tone on uncertain topics
- Internal contradictions

---

## 10. Verification Workflow
- Ask for sources
- Cross-check critical claims
- Compare with second tool/source
- Keep “trust but verify” for all high-stakes tasks

---

## 11. Responsible AI Use
- You are the author
- Never paste sensitive/client/company secrets
- Follow policy + compliance
- Disclose AI use when required

---

## 12. Tool Landscape: What to Use When
- ChatGPT: general productivity + writing
- Claude: long docs + instruction-following
- Gemini: Google ecosystem workflows
- Copilot: MS ecosystem + web-grounded tasks
- Perplexity: research + citations

---

## 13. Tool Selection Rule
“If task is ____, I use ____.”
- Drafting
- Research/fact-check
- Long analysis
- Workspace integration

---

## 14. Prompting Superpower
**5-Part Prompt Framework**
1. Role
2. Context
3. Task
4. Constraints
5. Example (optional)

---

## 15. Prompt Example (Weak vs Strong)
Weak: “Write marketing copy.”

Strong: “You are a B2B SaaS marketer. Create 3 LinkedIn posts for IT managers about reducing ticket backlog. Tone: practical, no hype. Include CTA. Max 120 words each.”

---

## 16. Iteration Loop
Draft → Review → Refine → Re-run
- Add missing context
- Tighten constraints
- Ask for alternatives
- Save winning prompts

---

## 17. Prompt Library Concept
Create reusable prompts for:
- Email replies
- Meeting agendas/minutes
- Project plans
- Option comparison
- Rewrite in my voice

---

## 18. Productivity Use Case: Email
- Draft faster
- Adjust tone for audience
- Clarify asks + deadlines
- Keep your own voice in final send

---

## 19. Productivity Use Case: Meetings
- Agenda generation
- Note cleanup
- Action items with owner + date
- Follow-up draft in minutes

---

## 20. Productivity Use Case: Documents
- Summarize long text
- Convert notes to structured reports
- Extract decisions/risks/next steps

---

## 21. Problem-Solving with AI
Use AI as a thinking partner:
- Option generation
- Pros/cons
- Priority sorting
- 2-week execution plan

---

## 22. Creative Work Without Losing Voice
- Use AI for ideation and first drafts
- Add your stories/examples/opinions
- Remove generic “AI-sounding” phrasing

---

## 23. Advanced Sampler (Optional)
- Spreadsheet formula help
- PDF extraction + action items
- Basic code support for non-coders
- Multi-step workflows

---

## 24. Safety + Over-Reliance Check
Watch for:
- Blind trust in outputs
- Not editing/reviewing
- Skill atrophy

Countermeasures:
- Verify
- Keep manual reps
- Use AI to learn, not avoid learning

---

## 25. Capstone: 30-Day Plan
- Pick top 3 recurring tasks
- Build 3 master prompts
- Week-by-week rollout
- Track time saved + quality improvements

---

## 26. Weekly Rollout Template
- Week 1: run 3 tasks once with AI
- Week 2: refine prompts + add checklist
- Week 3: repeat and teach someone
- Week 4: lock best prompts + monthly review

---

## 27. Success Metrics
- Hours saved/week
- Rework reduction
- Turnaround speed
- Confidence + consistency

---

## 28. Q&A
- What task are you implementing tomorrow?
- What risk do you need a guardrail for?
