## Slide 1 — Title (1 min)
**Say:**
“Welcome to AI Hero Academy. Today is hands-on. You’ll leave with a working system, not just theory.”

## Slide 2 — What Today Is About (1 min)
**Say:**
“AI is your assistant, not your replacement. We’re building practical habits you can use tomorrow.”

## Slide 3 — Outcomes (2 min)
**Say:**
“By end of day, you’ll know which tools to use, how to prompt well, and how to avoid risky mistakes.”

## Slide 4 — Ground Rules (2 min)
**Say:**
“Experiment is encouraged. Private data stays private. For important outputs: verify before use.”

## Slide 5 — Task Harvest (8–10 min)
**Prompt room:**
“Write 10–15 recurring tasks. Circle your top 3 highest-value time drains.”
**Facilitator move:** collect 4–6 examples on whiteboard for later demos.

## Slide 6 — AI Then vs Now (3 min)
**Say:**
“Old chatbots matched patterns. Modern models synthesize language contextually. That’s the shift.”

## Slide 7 — What AI Is/Isn’t (4 min)
**Say:**
“Great for drafts, restructuring, options. Not guaranteed factual or compliant without your review.”

## Slide 8 — Human+AI Partnership (3 min)
**Say:**
“Your job: context, constraints, decisions. AI’s job: speed and option generation.”

## Slide 9 — Hallucinations (5 min)
**Say:**
“AI can be confidently wrong. Watch for precise claims with no sources and fake citations.”

## Slide 10 — Verification Workflow (4 min)
**Say:**
“Sources, cross-check, second source/tool, then ship. Especially for legal/medical/financial/compliance.”

## Slide 11 — Responsible Use (4 min)
**Say:**
“You are accountable for outputs. No confidential data in public tools. Follow company policy.”

## Slide 12 — Tool Landscape (6 min)
**Say:**
“Different tools win at different jobs. There’s no one perfect model for everything.”
**Quick map:**
- ChatGPT = general + writing
- Claude = long docs
- Perplexity = citations
- Gemini/Copilot = ecosystem workflows

## Slide 13 — Tool Selection Rule (4 min)
**Say:**
“Create your rule now: ‘If task is X, I use Y.’ That removes decision fatigue.”

## Slide 14 — Prompting Framework (6 min)
**Teach:** Role, Context, Task, Constraints, Example.
**Say:** “Vague prompt = vague output.”

## Slide 15 — Weak vs Strong Prompt (5 min)
**Demo live:** improve a weak prompt using audience + outcome + format + limits.

## Slide 16 — Iteration Loop (4 min)
**Say:**
“First draft is normal. Prompting is iterative. Refine constraints and rerun.”

“Never outsource judgment. If AI is down, you should still be able to execute.”

## Slide 25 — Capstone Intro (3 min)
**Say:**
“Now we make your 30-day deployment plan. This is the most valuable part.”

## Slide 26 — Weekly Rollout (8 min)
