# AI Hero Academy — 6–8 Hour Course Plan

## Course Snapshot
- **Title:** AI Hero Academy: Practical AI for Work & Life
- **Length:** **7 hours instruction** (fits 6–8 hour request)
- **Format:** Hands-on workshop (about 60% practice / 40% instruction)
- **Audience:** Non-technical professionals, managers, founders, creators
- **Outcomes:** Choose tools, write strong prompts, verify outputs, apply AI safely to real work

---

## Learning Outcomes
By the end, learners will be able to:
1. Explain what AI is (and is not) in plain language.
2. Select the right AI tool for common tasks.
3. Use a 5-part prompt framework to get reliable output.
4. Apply AI to email, meetings, documents, and planning.
5. Detect hallucinations and verify high-stakes information.
6. Follow privacy/ethics rules for responsible use.
7. Leave with a 30-day personal AI implementation plan.

## 7-Hour Core Agenda (Instruction Time)

### Module 0 — Kickoff + Task Harvest (20 min)
**Goal:** Collect real participant pain points and frame AI as augmentation.
- Introductions + expectations
- “Top 3 time-wasters” exercise
- Device/account check

**Output:** Personal task list to use all day.

---

### Module 1 — AI Revolution, Capabilities, Limits (40 min)
**Goal:** Build realistic mental model of modern AI.
- Then vs now (ELIZA to modern LLMs)
- What AI does well vs poorly
- Human-in-the-loop workflow

**Exercise (10 min):** Compare AI answer vs trusted source.

---

### Module 2 — Responsible AI Use (45 min)
**Goal:** Prevent misuse, privacy leaks, and over-trust.
- Privacy rules: what never goes into public AI
- Plagiarism/integrity boundaries
- Trust-but-verify checklist

**Exercise (15 min):** Classify 6 scenarios as Safe / Unsafe / Needs anonymization.

---

### Module 3 — Tool Selection Bootcamp (40 min)
**Goal:** Choose tools by task (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Perplexity).
- Strengths/limitations matrix
- Context windows and when they matter
- Practical “if task is X, use Y” decision rule

**Exercise (10 min):** Pick one primary + one research/fact-check tool.

---

### Module 4 — Prompt Engineering Essentials (70 min)
**Goal:** Teach repeatable prompting that works first or second try.
- 5-part framework: **Role, Context, Task, Constraints, Example**
- Iteration loop: Draft → Critique → Refine
- Prompt library creation

**Workshop (35 min):** Build 3 reusable prompts from real tasks.

---

### Module 5 — Productivity Superpowers (80 min)
**Goal:** Apply AI to highest-frequency workplace tasks.
- Email drafting and tone transformation
- Meeting prep + meeting minutes + action items
- Report/summary generation
- Prioritization and planning

**Lab (45 min):** Complete one real deliverable end-to-end.

---

### Module 6 — Creativity + Voice Preservation (45 min)
**Goal:** Use AI for content without sounding generic.
- Idea generation frameworks
- Rewrite/edit while keeping personal voice
- “AI-sounding” cleanup pass

**Exercise (20 min):** Before/after rewrite in participant’s own style.

---

### Module 7 — Safety + Capstone Action Plan (60 min)
**Goal:** Lock in practical adoption with guardrails.
- Hallucination red flags and verification method
- Over-reliance warning signs
- 30-day rollout plan (Week 1–4)

**Capstone (40 min):**
- Pick top 3 recurring tasks
- Build 3 master prompts
- Define weekly adoption + time-saved tracker

---

## Optional Extensions (to reach full 8 hours)
Add any 1–2 blocks:
1. **AI Wake-Up Call (METR trends)** — 30–45 min
2. **Advanced sampler (data/PDF/code for non-coders)** — 30–40 min
3. **Industry breakout labs (healthcare/education/smb/corporate)** — 30–45 min

---

## 6-Hour Compressed Version
If you need a strict 6 hours, trim as follows:
- Module 3 Tool Selection: 40 → 25 min
- Module 6 Creativity: 45 → 25 min
- Module 7 Capstone: 60 → 45 min
- Keep Module 4 + 5 mostly intact (highest ROI)

---

## Materials to Provide
1. **Student Workbook** (notes + exercises + capstone sheets)
2. **Prompt Starter Library** (20+ templates)
3. **Tool Comparison One-Pager**
4. **Privacy + Verification Checklist**
5. **30-Day Action Plan Sheet**

---

## Assessment & Completion Criteria
Participants pass when they can:
- Produce 1 polished real-world deliverable with AI + human edits
- Demonstrate prompt framework correctly
- Show verification steps on one factual output
- Submit a 30-day AI implementation plan

---

## Instructor Notes
- Keep examples grounded in participant tasks from Module 0.
- Prioritize reps over theory.
- For high-stakes domains (legal/medical/finance), explicitly require expert verification.
- Emphasize: **AI assists judgment; it does not replace accountability.**
