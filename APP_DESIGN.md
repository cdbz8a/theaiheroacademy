# AI Hero Academy — App Design Blueprint

> Note: Detailed curriculum content now lives under `course-content/` in this repository.

## 1) Product Vision
**AI Hero Academy** is a learning app that helps beginners and professionals build practical AI skills through interactive lessons, projects, and mentorship.

The core promise: **learn AI by building real things**, not just watching videos.

---

## 2) Target Users
- **Beginners**: people with little or no coding background.
- **Career switchers**: professionals moving into AI-adjacent roles.
- **Builders**: developers, PMs, marketers, and founders who want to ship AI features.
- **Teams**: companies that want structured AI upskilling.

---

## 3) Learning Outcomes
Users should be able to:
1. Explain core AI concepts in plain language.
2. Prompt AI models effectively for different tasks.
3. Build simple AI workflows (chatbots, summarizers, content tools, automations).
4. Evaluate model quality, bias, and reliability.
5. Deploy beginner-friendly AI apps and iterate from user feedback.

---

## 4) Core User Experience
### A. Personalized Onboarding
- Initial assessment: goals, background, learning style, available time.
- Skill map generated by AI tutor.
- Personalized path (e.g., 15-min daily, weekend bootcamp, role-based tracks).

### B. Modular Curriculum
Each module includes:
- 5–10 minute concept lessons.
- Interactive sandboxes.
- Micro quizzes.
- Mini project.
- Reflection + portfolio artifact.

Proposed tracks:
- AI Foundations
- Prompt Engineering
- Build with APIs
- AI for Business Productivity
- Responsible AI
- Ship Your First AI Product

### C. AI Tutor Layer
- In-lesson chatbot explains concepts at multiple difficulty levels.
- “Explain this like I’m a beginner / PM / engineer” toggle.
- Debugging support for code and prompts.
- Adaptive hints instead of direct answers by default.

### D. Build Studio
- No-code and code modes.
- Drag-and-drop workflow builder (input → model → post-processing → output).
- Template gallery (resume reviewer, meeting summarizer, research assistant, etc.).
- One-click publish as web app/internal tool.

### E. Community + Accountability
- Cohorts and challenge-based learning.
- Weekly “ship day” events.
- Peer feedback and project reviews.
- Streaks, badges, and milestone certificates.

## 5) Key Features (MVP → V2)

## MVP (first release)
1. Authentication + profile.
2. Onboarding assessment + personalized roadmap.
3. 3 core tracks with interactive lessons.
4. AI tutor chat in lesson context.
5. Prompt playground + starter templates.
6. Progress dashboard.
7. Project portfolio page.

## V2+
1. Team/company admin dashboards.
2. Mentor office hours and live workshops.
3. Advanced evaluation tools (latency, cost, hallucination scoring).
4. Learning analytics for instructors.
5. Mobile apps + offline lesson mode.

---

## 6) Example Information Architecture
- **Home**: progress, daily goals, recommendations.
- **Learn**: modules, lessons, quizzes.
- **Build**: playground, templates, projects.
- **Community**: cohorts, discussions, events.
- **Portfolio**: completed projects + certificates.
- **Settings**: profile, billing, integrations.

---

## 7) Gamification Strategy
- XP for lessons, quizzes, and projects.
- Skill tree progression.
- “Boss battles” (capstone challenges).
- Weekly quest system.
- Public leaderboard (opt-in).

Focus on **competence signals** (what users can build), not vanity metrics.

---

## 8) Business Model
- **Free tier**: intro modules + limited tutor usage.
- **Pro ($20–40/month)**: full curriculum, unlimited tutor, project publishing.
- **Teams (B2B)**: seat-based pricing with admin tools and reporting.
- **Upsells**: certification exams, mentor sessions, career coaching.

---

## 9) Technical Architecture (Practical)
### Frontend
- React + Next.js
- Tailwind UI component system

### Backend
- Node.js (NestJS or Express)
- PostgreSQL (users, progress, projects)
- Redis (sessions, caching, rate limiting)

### AI Stack
- Multi-model gateway (OpenAI + Anthropic + open-source fallback)
- Prompt/version management
- Evaluation pipeline for prompt quality and output scoring

### Infra
- Vercel or AWS for deployment
- Object storage for user assets
- Observability: OpenTelemetry + centralized logging

### Security & Safety
- Role-based access control
- PII-aware logging and redaction
- Content moderation checks
- Abuse monitoring/rate limits

---

## 10) Responsible AI by Design
- Teach limitations and failure modes early.
- Show confidence/uncertainty and citation habits.
- Flag risky use cases and provide safe alternatives.
- Include bias/fairness exercises in curriculum.
- Require human-in-the-loop checkpoints for production workflows.

---

## 11) Metrics to Track
### Learning Metrics
- Lesson completion rate
- Quiz pass rate
- Time-to-first-project
- Project publish rate
- 30/60/90-day retention

### Product Metrics
- Daily active learners
- Tutor engagement depth
- Conversion free → pro
- Team expansion rate
- Net promoter score (NPS)

---

## 12) 90-Day Build Plan
### Days 1–30
- Validate target persona and curriculum outline.
- Build onboarding, auth, first track, and progress tracking.
- Implement basic AI tutor.

### Days 31–60
- Add prompt playground and project templates.
- Launch portfolio and certificate MVP.
- Run first beta cohort.

### Days 61–90
- Improve tutor adaptivity and feedback loops.
- Add community features and weekly challenges.
- Prepare paid plan + analytics dashboard.

## 13) Sample User Journey
1. User signs up and says: “I want to use AI for my marketing job.”
2. App gives a 4-week role-based plan.
3. User completes short lessons and AI-assisted exercises daily.
4. User builds a campaign brief generator in Build Studio.
5. User publishes project to portfolio and earns certificate.
6. User upgrades to Pro for advanced workflows.
