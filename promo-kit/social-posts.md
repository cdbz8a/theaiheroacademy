# AI Hero Academy — Social Post Pack

## Post 1 — Launch Announcement
AI tools are everywhere. Practical results are not.

That’s why I built **AI Hero Academy** — a hands-on workshop for professionals who want to use AI for real work (not just experiments).

You’ll learn:
- Better prompting
- Better workflows
- Better verification habits

If you want to become AI-confident in one day, details are here: [LINK]

## Post 2 — Pain Point Hook
If your AI output feels inconsistent, it’s not because you’re behind.

It’s usually because you’re missing a repeatable framework.

In AI Hero Academy, we fix that with:
- 5-part prompting method
- Tool-by-task decision rules
- Privacy + verification guardrails

Practical AI for work and life: [LINK]

Imagine leaving one workshop with:
✅ A personal prompt library
✅ A safer AI workflow
✅ A 30-day implementation plan

That’s the goal of AI Hero Academy.

No hype. No jargon. Just practical execution.
