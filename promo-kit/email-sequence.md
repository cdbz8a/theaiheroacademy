## Email 2 — Pain + Common Mistakes
**Subject options:**
- Why most AI usage stalls out
- 3 AI mistakes that waste your time

**Body:**
Hey [First Name],

Most people don’t fail with AI because they’re "bad at prompts." They fail because they’re missing a system.

Three common mistakes:
1) Vague inputs
2) No verification workflow
3) No rollout plan for real tasks

AI Hero Academy fixes all three in one practical workshop.
